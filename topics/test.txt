The "skyux test" command runs unit tests. The Karma unit test is configured under the hood to look for specific file names, similar to how SKY UX Builder looks for index.html files. The Karma unit test looks for any files in the src/app folder with names that end in .spec.ts. Users should write separate tests to confirm that the components work.
