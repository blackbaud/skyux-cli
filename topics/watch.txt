The "skyux watch" command runs the "test" command and watches the file system for changes. The "watch" command monitors changes in much the same way as the "serve" command, but for testing, "skyux watch" is always running, much like debug mode in Visual Studio. If you change a test, the window is watching that and runs the test. This command is useful when writing a bunch of tests.
